Blindness is a problem faced all over the world. There has been many navigation systems that have been proposed. However, sometimes the design has not been made based on the needs of the blind people. There is a need to study the needs of the blind people in order to design a practical object identification and navigation system. The blind people require a navigation system that is portable and able to help them perform the common chores such as cross the roads and avoid obstacles during their outdoor and indoor excursions while retaining the blind person’s identity that is the walking stick and black glasses.

To provide the blind people with a facility for proper navigation and object identification, we propose a system named as “ALOHOMORA”. It is a vision-based blind stick for the visually impaired people. It helps them in navigation and object and/or obstacle identification. It is easy-to-use and handy.

The model that we will be using for object identification has been trained on the images of famous and/or common objects and/or obstacles that can be encountered by a visually impaired person in everyday life. This information will act as the basis for the results given to the user.

Also, the distance to the object and/or obstacle will be calculated using a sensor and accordingly the information will be used to inform the person about the range or distance at which the object is. For this, we make use of a buzzer which can inform the person about the object and/or obstacle when it is within a specified range.
