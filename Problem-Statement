PROBLEM STATEMENT:
------------------

The blind people use the traditional long white cane as a device to help them for indoor and outdoor navigation. Even though it is cheap and requires minimal training for the blind to use it to find their way towards the place they want to go, only tactile information that is within the reach of the cane is available. For instance in outdoor usage where wide sidewalks are common, the use of the white cane can be difficult. Mud and other off-road conditions would certainly aggravate the challenge of using the cane for independent travel.

The traditional white cane lacks intelligent technology which can help in decreasing the level of difficulties faced by the blind people. It is unable to warn the user about an obstacle in their path until the cane has made contact with it. Many accidents happen because of this. These accidents might lead to serious injury.

Besides, white cane also does not has the ability to guide the blind person to travel to desired location. Blind people might get lost and face some risk or danger when they need to travel. They need to depend on people to bring them to a certain location or they can only travel in a place they are familiar with. Loss of eyesight brings much inconvenience to a blind person.

To provide the blind people with a facility for proper navigation and object identification, we propose a system named as “ALOHOMORA”. It is a vision-based blind stick for the visually impaired people. It helps them in navigation and object and/or obstacle identification.
